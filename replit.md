# GPT Bypass - AI Text Rewriter

## Overview

GPT Bypass is a comprehensive AI text rewriting application designed to transform AI-generated content to bypass detection tools. The system provides surgical style mimicking capabilities using multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Perplexity) and integrates with GPTZero for AI detection scoring. Users can upload documents, apply style samples, customize rewrite instructions, and process text through intelligent chunking for large documents.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

**Stripe Payment System with Atomic Credit Fulfillment (October 4, 2025)**
- Implemented production-ready Stripe payment integration with database transactions for atomic credit fulfillment
- **Payment Tiers**: ZHI 1-4 credit packages at $5 (500 credits), $10 (1,050 credits), $25 (2,750 credits), $50 (5,750 credits), $100 (12,000 credits)
- **Transactional Processing**: Database transactions wrap payment insert and credit increment for atomicity (both succeed or both roll back)
- **Idempotency Protection**: Unique constraint on `stripe_payment_intent_id` prevents duplicate credit grants from concurrent requests
- **Dual Fulfillment**: Both `/api/verify-payment` endpoint and Stripe webhook handle credit fulfillment with shared transactional logic
- **Atomic Credit Increment**: SQL-level `UPDATE users SET credits = credits + $1` prevents read-modify-write race conditions
- **Error Handling**: Unique constraint violations caught gracefully, indicating payment already processed
- **Payment Tracking**: `payments` table stores all successful transactions with Stripe payment intent ID, user ID, credits, and amount
- **Real-time Updates**: Frontend invalidates user query cache after payment for immediate credit balance refresh
- **Security**: Payment verification confirms Stripe payment status and user ownership before granting credits

**User Authentication & Persistence System (October 3, 2025)**
- Implemented complete optional authentication system - site remains fully accessible to guest users
- **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, migrated from memory storage to persistent storage
- **Secure Authentication**: Passport.js integration with scrypt password hashing, session management, and secure cookie handling
- **Auth Endpoints**: Registration, login, logout with proper validation using Zod schemas and JSON error responses
- **Security Hardening**: All user responses sanitized to exclude hashed passwords, request validation on all auth routes
- **Frontend Integration**: Login/register UI in header with AuthProvider hook, seamless user experience
- **User Dashboard**: View saved materials (documents and rewrite jobs) when logged in at /dashboard route
- **Material Persistence**: Documents and rewrite jobs automatically save with userId when user is authenticated
- **Guest Access**: Full application functionality available without login - authentication is optional enhancement
- **Session Management**: Express-session with PostgreSQL store (connect-pg-simple) for production-ready session persistence

**GPTZero Integration Fixed (October 2, 2025)**
- Successfully updated GPTZero API key with proper authentication

**PDF Binary-Safe Processing (Confirmed Working)**
- Dedicated `/api/pdf/extract` endpoint using multer memory storage
- Clean text extraction using pdf-parse library

**Advanced Preset System Implementation**
- Added comprehensive PRESET_TEXT mapping with 40+ precise rewrite instructions
- Implemented expandPresets function for combo preset handling ("Lean & Sharp", "Analytic")
- Created unified buildRewritePrompt function replacing individual provider prompt logic
- Added "Advanced Techniques" category with 8 sophisticated instructions:
  - Mixed cadence + clause sprawl, Asymmetric emphasis, One aside, Hedge twice
  - Local disfluency, Analogy injection, Topic snap, Friction detail
- All AI providers now use consistent prompt structure with proper preset integration
- Removed deprecated buildSystemPrompt method for cleaner codebase

**Default AI Provider Update**
- Changed default AI provider from OpenAI to Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4
- Updated both main interface and chat interface to default to Anthropic
- Maintains full multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Perplexity)

**Default Style Sample Configuration**
- Set "Formal and Functional Relationships" as the default style sample
- Automatically loads in style text box when application starts
- Pre-selected in the LeftSidebar dropdown for immediate use
